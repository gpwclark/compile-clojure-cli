# initial
-	building the Dockerfile `docker build -t clj-graal .`, compiles the project
in testgraal to a binary.
-	to get compiled binary either use docker cp or mount a volume where the
binary is made `/home/clj/app/target/testgraal-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone`

# testgraal

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

## Usage
-	build 
``
./build.sh
```
-	to use
```
./run.sh --help
```
-	this scripts uses entyrpoint/command tricks to essentially turn the compiled
clj app into an "executable" docker container. If this is not what you want I 
recommend starting the container, and using "docker cp" to extract the executable
or using the -v parameter to get the binary out of the running container.
## Compare
To test the difference between the two...
```
docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash testgraal
```
time java -jar ./target/testgraal --help
```
	on my hardware: `target/testgraal --help  0.00s user 0.00s system 96% cpu 0.004 total`
versus
```
lein uberjar
time java -jar ./target/testgraal-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar --help
```
	on my hardware: `java -jar testgraal-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar --help  3.68s user 0.19s system 216% cpu 1.787 total`
